# Debt Approval CLI

The Debt Approval Command Line Interface (CLI) is a credit determination tool for predicting the probability of approval for unsecured personal loans using a machine learning model trained on historical LendingClub data.

**Link to dataset: [All Lending Club loan data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club/data)**

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python, Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn

The public dataset from LendingClub was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling using Jupyter notebooks. A logistic regression model was trained to predict loan approval chances based on various borrower attributes with scikit-learn. The final model was then integrated into a Python-based CLI application that allows users to input their financial details and receive an estimated approval probability.

## Optimizations

- More advanced feature engineering techniques could be applied to enhance model performance.
- Hyperparameter tuning using grid search or random search could improve the logistic regression model.

## Lessons Learned

- Gained experience in data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas.
- Developed skills in building and evaluating machine learning models with scikit-learn.
- Learned how to create a user-friendly CLI application in Python.
